##  Adjust region size and position

 Use mouse to adjust your region size and position. You can precisely control region size and position with keyboard: use **arrows** to move region, use **SHIFT + arrows** to resize region. Green region frame indicates that region is accepted and Action! is ready to capture screenshots. Gray frame indicates that current region is not accepted and you cannot capture screenshots.
