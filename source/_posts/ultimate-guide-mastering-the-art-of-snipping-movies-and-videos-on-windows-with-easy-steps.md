##  Introduction 

 Mirillis Action! allows you to capture/record any video that you are playing on your PC. With the best recording performance on the market you can capture any video played on your PC (including all media players videos, web players, live streamed videos etc.) in superb and smooth quality. 

 To capture a video, you can use two different methods.

 To capture video played in fullscreen mode it is the best to use the Active Screen Recording mode. Run Mirillis Action! video capturing application and make sure that the Active Screen Recording mode is selected.
