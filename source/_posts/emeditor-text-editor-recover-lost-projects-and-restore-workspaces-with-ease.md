It seems that setting customizewindow – “Restore Workspace automaticly” does not work. It seems to save it when the option is set but not restore.

 You will need to check both “Restore Workspace” and “Save Workspace”.

 If you try to open a particular file with EmEditor — like double-clicking a file in Explorer — then, not all files will be restore but just a file you try to open. If you run EmEditor without any files in command line, then all the saved files should be restored. This is the specification now, but I might add an option in the future.

 I am not doing this.

 This is what I am doing and it is not restoring the workspace.  
 However,I know that the workspace is being saved because if I left click on the emEditor Icon on the task basr and select restore workspace it does restore.

 Like the other issue, can you please email me at [tech@emurasoft.com](https://tools.techidaily.com/emeditor/products/) with the exported settings after zipped? I tried with your settings you emailed me before, but “Restore Workspace” and “Save Workspace” checkboxes are not checked. When I checked these options, the workspace did restore correctly. I must have used different settings. So, if you can email me the settings when you have this issue, I will try to debug the issue. Thank you!

 I received your email. It seems that the “EmEditor Quick Start” option in the Shortcut tab of Customize dialog did not work with Auto Restore Workspace. Please uncheck “EmEditor Quick Start” option in the Shortcut tab of Customize dialog” while I am working on this issue. Thank you for finding this bug!
